import { Example1 } from './subclassing-example.js';

This tutorial has been created for a StackOverflow question where a user needed to do a text object in Fabric.js that works with bitmaps instead of fonts. The code example contains everything you need to know to start a subclass. Consider that subclassing is a sort of last resort when you can't obtain the needed functionality with other APIs (events, custom controls).
