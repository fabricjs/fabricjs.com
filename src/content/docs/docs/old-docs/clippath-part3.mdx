We can apply a clipPath to a StaticCanvas exactly as we do for objects. The clipPath in this case is influenced by zoom and pan and contrary from Object.clipPath is positioned fom the top-left corner.

<Example1 client:idle />

As the old clipTo function, clipPath is clipping controls too, unless you use canvas.controlsAboveOverlay set to true

<Example2 client:idle />

### Animating the clipPaths

ClipPaths can be animated as any other object. Canvas clipPath animation is very efficent, while animating the Object's one will invalidate the object cache each time.

<Example3 client:idle />
