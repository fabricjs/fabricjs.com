    Improvement: Made iText keymap public. #4053
    Improvement: Fix a bug in updateCacheCanvas that was returning always true #4051
  

### Version 1.7.14

Cache improvement release! Two new features are now in the cache system. The cache will not grow over certain sizes when scaling objects, and also the \_cacheCanvas will be resized in advance by a 10% margin so that we do not have to resize each mousemove event.  
Check [here](/fabric-object-caching) for more details  
The staefull check has been speed up a bit taking inspiration from `fast-deep-equal` package on npm.  
Some bug relative to deep state check and group that where invalidating the cache for weird reason have been hopefully solved.

    Fix: After addWithUpdate or removeWithUpdate object coords must be updated. #3911
  

### Version 1.7.11

    Hotifx for broken PathGroups (SVGs)

### Version 1.7.10

Many fixes to be a minor release:  
Fixes to SVG export for polygons and for radial gradients in general. Introducing a caching logic for groups that allow to smart cache what has not shadow as children object. This should reduce caching visual errors by much and still allowing for cache optimization.  
Introduced some manual checks on the value of Math.cos so that we can output a correct angle of 90 or 270 degrees for objects.

    Fix: correct svg export for radial gradients #3807
    Fix: Update fireout events to export the event object #3853
    Fix: Improve callSuper to avoid infinite loops (not all of them) #3844
    Fix: avoid selectionBackgroundColor leak on toDataUrl #3862
    Fix: toDatelessObject for Group #3863
    Improvement: better caching logic for groups #3864
    Fix: correct svg gradient export for radial in polygons #3866
    Fix: First draw could be empty for some objects #3870
    Fix: Always send event data to object:selected #3871
    Improvement: reduce angle calculation error #3872
  

### Version 1.7.9

Small fixes for text related problems. If you are using text in your application, you should update.

    Fix: Avoid textarea wrapping from chome v57+ #3804
    Fix: double click needed to move cursor when enterEditing is called programatically #3804
    Fix: Style regression when inputing new style objects #3804
    Add: try to support crossOrigin for svg image tags #3804
  

### Version 1.7.8 and 1.7.7

This is maybe the last release of the 1.x branch. New important and api breaking work is in progress and will be labeled as fabric 2.x  
The change i like most comes from a casual contributor, `by12` and fixes path bounding box calculation. No more trimmed paths!  
A change in translation on the cache canvas fixed blurriness introduced since 1.7.3, that is also worth an update.  
For iText, Textbox typers, the style object does not get polluted with useless empty objects now.  
And last but not the least, we have a new flag called `fabric.StaticCanvas.prototype.skipOffscreen` default to `false` that will calculate with objects aCoords if the object is on the screen or outside the screen and will skip the rendering part completely. This is an optional feature but it turns out to be very usefull when you are dealing with large number of objects and you are using zoom or panning much.  
While object.oCoords needs to be updated every zoom/pan, aCoords are static with object position and are still valid when we change the viewport. This allows us to detect if they are offscreen simply calculating the viewportCoords at the expense of 2 transformed points calculation. A demo page will follow soon.

    Fix: Fix dirty flag propagation #3782
    Fix: Path parsing error in bounding boxes of curves #3774
    Add: Middle click mouse management on canvas #3764
    Add: Add parameter to detect and skip offscreen drawing #3758
    Fix: textarea loosing focus after a drag and exit from canvas #3759
    Fix for opacity parsing in svg with nested opacities #3747
    Fix text initialization and boundingrect #3745
    Fix line bounding box #3742
    Improvement: do not pollute style object while typing if not necessary #3743
    fix for broken prototype chain when restoring a dataless object on fill an stroke #3735
    fix for deselected event not fired on mouse actions #3716
    fix for blurriness introduced on 1.7.3 #3721
  

### Version 1.7.6 ( plus 1.7.5 and 1.7.4)

New functionalities about coordinates: Now setCoords updates both the corner coords for mouse interaction and a new set called aCoords that is a set of absolute coordinates that a dev can use for its own calculation on positions.  
Introduced a set of coordinates on canvas that let you figure out where the current viewport start and finish. A new method for objects, called \`isOnScreen\` let;s you find out if at least a corner of an object is visible in the current viewport Fabric.Color class now can export colors in HEX + opacity format Notable fixes: We switched some touch event handling to accomodate latest chrome changes Removed gaps on continuos textbackgroundColor on Itext

    Fix: make the cacheCanvas created on the fly if not available
    Improvement: draw textbackgroundColor in one single pass when possible
    Improvement: fire selection changed event just if text is editing
    Improvement: Add object property 'needsItsOwnCache'
    Improvement: Skip unnecessary transform if they can be detected with a single if
    Fix: Moved all the touch event to passive false so that they behave as before chrome changes
    Fix: force top and left in the object representation of a path to avoid reparsing on restore
    Add: Enable deselected event for activeObject switch. Ensure deactivateAll call exitEditing
    Fix: Perform subtargetCheck also if the group is an active object and on activeGroup
    Fix: Made cursor operation more precise at high canvas zoom level
    Add: Made getBoundingRect available to return both absolute or standard bounding rect
    Add: Introduced calcViewportBoundaries() function for fabric.StaticCanvas
    Add: Introduced isOnScreen() function for fabric.Object
    Subclassed Polygon from polyline
    Fix: Removed reference to hovered target when target gets removed
    Fix: Removed hover cursor for non selectable objects
    Fix: Switch to passive event for touch move
    Fix: Restart rendering of cursor after entering some text
    Add: fabric.Color support toHexa() method now
  

### Version 1.7.3

Mixed release, cleaning and important bugfixes.  
Objects `fromObject` methods have been reworked to be able to wait for Patterns full loading process before actually creating the object, so that the first render has the pattern ready to show. That was a longstanding bug since 2013.  
Reworked some of the canvas background and overlay code so that gradient and patterns works and are saved and reloaded correctly.  
During loadFromJSON process, if an image errors out, the process cotinue smooth, the reviver function is invoked with a third argument `error` equal to true.  
Usuals objectCaching improvements: dirty flag propagation from childObjects to parents, added a couple of pixels around the cache canvas to avoid aliasing, added bigger padding for text with custom fonts.

    Improvement: mousewheel event has target in the arguments as all the other events. object now fires mousewheel
    Improvement: Pattern loads for canvas background and overlay, corrected svg pattern export.
    Fix: Wait for pattern loading before calling callback.
    Fix: add 2 extra pixels to cache canvases to avoid aliasing cut.
    Fix: Rerender when deselect an itext editing object.
    Fix: save new state of dimensionProperties at every cache clear.
    Improvement: Better error managment in loadFromJSON.
    Improvement: do not reload backgroundImage as an image if is different type.
    Improvement: if a children element is set dirty, set the parent dirty as well.

### Version 1.6.5

A bugfix release with some small news:  
New feature `backgroundColor` is now supported from all classes.  
`Clone` and `fromObject` methods are now equal for all classes. You can use the callback for any cloning.  
Right click `mouse:down` support. disabled by default can be enabled using the `fireRightClick` property and the canvas element context menu can be disabled enabling `stopContextMenu` on the fabric canvas.

The font-family quoting from 1.6.4 has been reverted because it made no possible to use multiple font family names. So if you are using a font family that has a name with spaces and numbers you have to wrap in in quotes by yourself.

    Fix: Error in dataURL with multiplier was outputting very big canvas with retina #3314
    Fix: Error in style map was not respecting style if textbox started with space #3315
  

### Version 1.6.4

In fabric 1.6.4 we added some new features and refinement to text objects:  
New feature `charspacing` has been added, charspacing is expressed in thousands of em unit, meaning that with a value of 1000 and a fontsize of 40, you will have an additional space of 40px between chars.  
Lineheight managment has been improved, now the lineheight does not have an extra padding below the line if there are no other lines of text.  
Now that HiddenTextarea of iText object can follow the typing cursor better, it has been attached again to body of document and thanks to this IE browsers copy paste has been fixed.  
`selection:changed` event firing has been reduced so that it fires just when necessary  
Fonts with particular names, like 'Slabo 27px' or 'Exo 2' should be handled correctly now.

We have one new filter, a generic `ColorMatrix` filter from one of our contributors.

An old missing feature has been finally added, when restoring object from JSON, the apply filter function is executed before firing the callback, so that we can re render the canvas when everything is properly set up

Other small fixes to svg import and zoomed canvas. Finally shift click to select and unselect should work on every canvas zoom/pan.

New event: `object:deselected` is fired when an object loose its active state. Other than that, to the `before:selection:cleared` and `selection:cleared` the target is passed as an argument to the event fired.

Events will fire for both the group and all the list of sub targets found in case of nested groups

Other changes inclued better handling of pan and zooming. Transparency checking is now aware of current viewportTransform and 3 new functions have been added to center objects in the current viewport instead of canvas: `viewportCenterObject`, `viewportCenterObjectH`, `viewportCenterObjectV`.

### Version 1.6.2

![](/article_assets/1.6.2.png)

With 1.6.2 we introduce some new customization options for controls and user interaction. It is now possible to customize the keys used for control interaction.  
Before those where the predefined keys:

  Alt Key: Switching from normal transform to centered transform during scaling objects.
  Shift Key: on br,bl,tr,lt was switching from proportional to free resize, on mt, ml, mr, bw was switching between resize and skew.
  

As of 1.6.2 is possible to use those configuration option to define which keys are used:

  \* values: altKey, shiftKey, ctrlKey,
  fabric.Object.uniScaleKey: key used to switch between proportional and not proportional scaling
  fabric.Object.altActionKey: key used to switch between different action on same corner (skew/scale)
  fabric.Object.centeredKey: key used to switch on/off the centered transform
  

`hoverCursor` now appears also on non selectable objects but `moveCursor` does not appear if the object can't be moved. In addition `moveCursor` is now customizable with the property `moveCursor`.  
The biggest change is the possibility of cusomizing the look of controls. Both border and controls can be filled and stroked and can also have a dash-array instead of a continue line. Corners can be both square or round.  
To control those feature you can use those new properties:

  borderDashArray: Dash stroke of borders
  cornerDashArray: Dash stroke of corners
  cornerStrokeColor: If corners are filled, this property controls the color of the stroke
  cornerStyle: standrd 'rect' or 'circle'
  selectionBackgroundColor: add an opaque or transparent layer to the selected object.
  

Small bugfixes includes: Itext firing `object:modified` on text change, possibility to restore custom canvas properties other than objects during canvas loadFromJSON, some SVG color output fix and some dataURL improvements.  
This is the raw changelog:

    Fix: restore canvas properties on loadFromJSON with includeProperties. #2921
    Fix: Allow hoverCursor on non selectable objects, moveCursor does not appear if the object is not moveable. Added object.moveCursor to specify a cursor for moving per object. #2924
    Fix: Add missing stroke.live translation, allow gradientTransform for dashed line. #2926
    Improvement: Allow customization of keys that iteract with mouse action ( multiselect key, free tranform key, alternative action key, centered transform key ) #2925
    Added: Make iText fires object:modified on text change on exit editing #2927
    Added: \[control customization part 1\] cornerDashArray, borderDashArray. Now borderScaleFactor influences both border and controls, changed default corner size to 13 #2932
    Fix: createSVGFontFacesMarkup was failing to retrieve fonts in style #2935
    Fix: shadow not scaled with dataUrl to multiplier #2940
    Added: \[control customization part 2\] cornerStrokeColor. Now is possible to specify separate stroke and fill color for the controls #2933
    Fix: Itext width calculation with caching false was returning nan. #2943
    Added: \[control customization part 3\] Rounded corners. It is possible to specify cornerStyle for the object. 'rect' or 'circle' #2942
    Added: \[control customization part 4\] Selection background. It is possible to specify selectionBackgroundColor for the object. #2950
    Fix: Behaviour of image with filters with resize effects and Object to/from json #2954
    Fix: Svg export should not output color notation in rgba format #2955
    Fix: minScaleLimit rounding bug #2964
    Fix: Itext spacing in justify mode bug #2971
    Fix: Object.toDataUrl export when some window.devicepixelRatio is present (retina or browser zoom) #2972
