<p>An even more expressive way to work with colors is via gradients. Gradients allow us to blend one color into another, creating some stunning graphical effects.</p>

<p>Fabric supports gradients via <code>setGradient</code> method, defined on all objects. Calling <code>setGradient('fill', { ... })</code> is just like setting "fill" value of an object, except that we fill object with gradient, rather than single color.</p>

<pre>
var circle = new fabric.Circle({
  left: 100,
  top: 100,
  radius: 50
});

circle.setGradient('fill', {
  x1: 0,
  y1: 0,
  x2: 0,
  y2: circle.height,
  colorStops: {
    0: '#000',
    1: '#fff'
  }
});
</pre>

<p>In the above example, we create a circle at 100,100 location, with 50px radius. We then set its fill to a gradient that spans throughout entire height of that circle, from black to white.</p>

<p>The argument passed to a method is an options object, which expects 2 coordinate pairs (x1, y1 and x2, y2), as well as "colorStops" object. Coordinates specify where gradient starts and where it ends. colorStops specify which colors a gradient is made of. You can define as many color stops as you want, as long as they range from 0 to 1 (e.g. 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.75, 1). 0 represents beginning of a gradient, 1 &mdash; its end.</p>

<p>Coordinates are relative to object top left corner, so the highest point of the circle is <code>0</code>, and the lowest point is <code>circle.height</code>. <code>setGradient</code> calculates width coordinates (x1, x2) in the same way.

<p>Here's an example of left-to-right red-blue gradient:</p>

<pre>
circle.setGradient('fill', {
  x1: 0,
  y1: 0,
  x2: circle.width,
  y2: 0,
  colorStops: {
    0: "red",
    1: "blue"
  }
});
</pre>

<p>And here's a 5-stops rainbow gradient, with colors spanning at even 20% intervals:</p>

<pre>
circle.setGradient('fill', {
  x1: 0,
  y1: 0,
  x2: circle.width,
  y2: 0,
  colorStops: {
    0: "red",
    0.2: "orange",
    0.4: "yellow",
    0.6: "green",
    0.8: "blue",
    1: "purple"
  }
});
</pre>

<p>Which cool versions can you come up with?</p>
