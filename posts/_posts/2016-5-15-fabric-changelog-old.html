  <h3>Version 1.7.6 ( plus 1.7.5 and 1.7.4)</h3>
  <p>
    New functionalities about coordinates:
    Now setCoords updates both the corner coords for mouse interaction and a new set called aCoords that is a set of absolute coordinates that a dev can use for its own calculation on positions.<br />
    Introduced a set of coordinates on canvas that let you figure out where the current viewport start and finish.
    A new method for objects, called `isOnScreen` let;s you find out if at least a corner of an object is visible in the current viewport
    Fabric.Color class now can export colors in HEX + opacity format
    Notable fixes:
    We switched some touch event handling to accomodate latest chrome changes
    Removed gaps on continuos textbackgroundColor on Itext
  </p>

    Improvement: Skip unnecessary transform if they can be detected with a single if
    Fix: Moved all the touch event to passive false so that they behave as before chrome changes
    Fix: force top and left in the object representation of a path to avoid reparsing on restore
    Add: Enable deselected event for activeObject switch. Ensure deactivateAll call exitEditing
    Fix: Perform subtargetCheck also if the group is an active object and on activeGroup
    Fix: Made cursor operation more precise at high canvas zoom level
    Add: Made getBoundingRect available to return both absolute or standard bounding rect

  </pre>

  <h3>Version 1.7.3</h3>
  <p>Mixed release, cleaning and important bugfixes.<br /> Objects <code>fromObject</code> methods have been reworked to be able to wait for Patterns
  full loading process before actually creating the object, so that the first render has the pattern ready to show. That was a longstanding bug since 2013.<br />
  Reworked some of the canvas background and overlay code so that gradient and patterns works and are saved and reloaded correctly.<br />
  During loadFromJSON process, if an image errors out, the process cotinue smooth, the reviver function is invoked with a third argument <code>error</code>
  equal to true.<br/>
  Usuals objectCaching improvements: dirty flag propagation from childObjects to parents, added a couple of pixels around the cache canvas to avoid aliasing,
  added bigger padding for text with custom fonts.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Improvement: mousewheel event has target in the arguments as all the other events. object now fires mousewheel
    Improvement: Pattern loads for canvas background and overlay, corrected svg pattern export.
    Fix: Wait for pattern loading before calling callback.
    Fix: add 2 extra pixels to cache canvases to avoid aliasing cut.
    Fix: Rerender when deselect an itext editing object.
    Fix: save new state of dimensionProperties at every cache clear.
    Improvement: Better error managment in loadFromJSON.
    Improvement: do not reload backgroundImage as an image if is different type.
    Improvement: if a children element is set dirty, set the parent dirty as well.

  </p>
  <p>
    The font-family quoting from 1.6.4 has been reverted because it made no possible to use multiple font family names. So if you are using a font family that has a name with spaces and numbers you have to wrap in in quotes by yourself.

  </pre>

  <h3>Version 1.6.4</h3>
  <p>In fabric 1.6.4 we added some new features and refinement to text objects:
    <br />New feature <code>charspacing</code> has been added, charspacing is expressed in thousands of em unit, meaning that with a value of 1000 and a fontsize of 40, you will have an additional space of 40px between chars.
    <br />Lineheight managment has been improved, now the lineheight does not have an extra padding below the line if there are no other lines of text.
    <br />Now that HiddenTextarea of iText object can follow the typing cursor better, it has been attached again to body of document and thanks to this IE browsers copy paste has been fixed.
    <br /><code>selection:changed</code> event firing has been reduced so that it fires just when necessary
    <br />Fonts with particular names, like 'Slabo 27px' or 'Exo 2' should be handled correctly now.
  </p>
  <p>We have one new filter, a generic <code>ColorMatrix</code> filter from one of our contributors.</p>
  <p>An old missing feature has been finally added, when restoring object from JSON, the apply filter function is executed before firing the callback, so that we can re render the canvas when everything is properly set up</p>
  <p>Other small fixes to svg import and zoomed canvas. Finally shift click to select and unselect should work on every canvas zoom/pan.</p>
  <p>New event: <code>object:deselected</code> is fired when an object loose its active state. Other than that, to the <code>before:selection:cleared</code> and <code>selection:cleared</code> the target is passed as an argument to the event fired.</p>
  <p>This is the raw changelog:</p>
  <pre>

  <h3>Version 1.6.2</h3>
  <img src="/article_assets/1.6.2.png" style="margin-bottom:20px">

  <p>With 1.6.2 we introduce some new customization options for controls and user interaction. It is now possible to customize the keys used for control interaction.<br />Before those where the predefined keys:</p>
  <pre>
  Alt Key: Switching from normal transform to centered transform during scaling objects.
  Shift Key: on br,bl,tr,lt was switching from proportional to free resize, on mt, ml, mr, bw was switching between resize and skew.
  </pre>
  <p>As of 1.6.2 is possible to use those configuration option to define which keys are used:</p>
  <pre>
  * values: altKey, shiftKey, ctrlKey,
  fabric.Object.uniScaleKey: key used to switch between proportional and not proportional scaling
  fabric.Object.altActionKey: key used to switch between different action on same corner (skew/scale)
  fabric.Object.centeredKey: key used to switch on/off the centered transform
  </pre>
  <p><code>hoverCursor</code> now appears also on non selectable objects but <code>moveCursor</code> does not appear if the object can't be moved. In addition <code>moveCursor</code> is now customizable with the property <code>moveCursor</code>.
  <br/>The biggest change is the possibility of cusomizing the look of controls. Both border and controls can be filled and stroked and can also have a dash-array instead of a continue line. Corners can be both square or round.<br />To control those feature you can use those new properties:
  <pre>
  borderDashArray: Dash stroke of borders
  cornerDashArray: Dash stroke of corners
  cornerStrokeColor: If corners are filled, this property controls the color of the stroke
  cornerStyle: standrd 'rect' or 'circle'
  selectionBackgroundColor: add an opaque or transparent layer to the selected object.
  </pre>
  </p>

  <p>Small bugfixes includes: Itext firing <code>object:modified</code> on text change, possibility to restore custom canvas properties other than objects during canvas loadFromJSON, some SVG color output fix and some dataURL improvements.<br />This is the raw changelog:</p>

  Improvement: Allow customization of keys that iteract with mouse action ( multiselect key, free tranform key, alternative action key, centered transform key ) #2925
  Added: Make iText fires object:modified on text change on exit editing #2927
  Added: [control customization part 1] cornerDashArray, borderDashArray. Now borderScaleFactor influences both border and controls, changed default corner size to 13 #2932
