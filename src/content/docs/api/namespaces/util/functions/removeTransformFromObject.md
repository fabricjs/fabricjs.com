> **removeTransformFromObject**(`object`, `transform`): `void`

given an object and a transform, apply the inverse transform to the object,
this is equivalent to remove from that object that transformation, so that
added in a space with the removed transform, the object will be the same as before.
Removing from an object a transform that scale by 2 is like scaling it by 1/2.
Removing from an object a transform that rotate by 30deg is like rotating by 30deg
in the opposite direction.
This util is used to add objects inside transformed groups or nested groups.

## Parameters

• **object**: `FabricObject`\<`Partial`\<`ObjectProps`\>, [`SerializedObjectProps`](/api/interfaces/serializedobjectprops/), [`ObjectEvents`](/api/interfaces/objectevents/)\>

the object you want to transform

• **transform**: [`TMat2D`](/api/type-aliases/tmat2d/)

the destination transform

## Returns

`void`

## Defined in

src/util/misc/objectTransforms.ts:23
