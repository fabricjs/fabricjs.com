  <h3>Version 1.6.5</h3>

  <p>A bugfix release with some small news:
    <br />New feature <code>backgroundColor</code> is now supported from all classes.
    <br /><code>Clone</code> and <code>fromObject</code> methods are now equal for all classes. You can use the callback for any cloning.
    <br />Right click <code>mouse:down</code> support. disabled by default can be enabled using the <code>fireRightClick</code> property and the canvas element context menu can be disabled enabling <code>stopContextMenu</code> on the fabric canvas.
  </p>
  <p>
    The font-family quoting from 1.6.4 has been reverted because it made no possible to use multiple font family names. So if you are using a font family that has a name with spaces and numbers you have to wrap in in quotes by yourself.

  </pre>

  <h3>Version 1.6.4</h3>

  <p>In fabric 1.6.4 we added some new features and refinement to text objects:
    <br />New feature <code>charspacing</code> has been added, charspacing is expressed in thousands of em unit, meaning that with a value of 1000 and a fontsize of 40, you will have an additional space of 40px between chars.
    <br />Lineheight managment has been improved, now the lineheight does not have an extra padding below the line if there are no other lines of text.
    <br />Now that HiddenTextarea of iText object can follow the typing cursor better, it has been attached again to body of document and thanks to this IE browsers copy paste has been fixed.
    <br /><code>selection:changed</code> event firing has been reduced so that it fires just when necessary
    <br />Fonts with particular names, like 'Slabo 27px' or 'Exo 2' should be handled correctly now.
  </p>
  <p>We have one new filter, a generic <code>ColorMatrix</code> filter from one of our contributors.</p>
  <p>An old missing feature has been finally added, when restoring object from JSON, the apply filter function is executed before firing the callback, so that we can re render the canvas when everything is properly set up</p>
  <p>Other small fixes to svg import and zoomed canvas. Finally shift click to select and unselect should work on every canvas zoom/pan.</p>
  <p>New event: <code>object:deselected</code> is fired when an object loose its active state. Other than that, to the <code>before:selection:cleared</code> and <code>selection:cleared</code> the target is passed as an argument to the event fired.</p>
  <p>This is the raw changelog:</p>

  <h3>Version 1.6.3</h3>

  <p>Biggest new in 1.6.3 is support of sub-targets in group. Group has a new property <code>subTargetCheck</code> default to false that allows the findTarget
    functions to go deep in the group nested objects.<br />Events will fire for both the group and all the list of sub targets found in case of nested groups</p>
  <p>Other changes inclued better handling of pan and zooming. Transparency checking is now aware of current viewportTransform and 3 new functions have been
     added to center objects in the current viewport instead of canvas: <code>viewportCenterObject</code>, <code>viewportCenterObjectH</code>, <code>viewportCenterObjectV</code>.

  <h3>Version 1.6.2</h3>
  <img src="/article_assets/1.6.2.png" style="margin-bottom:20px">

  <p>With 1.6.2 we introduce some new customization options for controls and user interaction. It is now possible to customize the keys used for control interaction.<br />Before those where the predefined keys:</p>
  <pre>
  Alt Key: Switching from normal transform to centered transform during scaling objects.
  Shift Key: on br,bl,tr,lt was switching from proportional to free resize, on mt, ml, mr, bw was switching between resize and skew.
  </pre>
  <p>As of 1.6.2 is possible to use those configuration option to define which keys are used:</p>
  <pre>
  * values: altKey, shiftKey, ctrlKey,
  fabric.Object.uniScaleKey: key used to switch between proportional and not proportional scaling
  fabric.Object.altActionKey: key used to switch between different action on same corner (skew/scale)
  fabric.Object.centeredKey: key used to switch on/off the centered transform
  </pre>
  <p><code>hoverCursor</code> now appears also on non selectable objects but <code>moveCursor</code> does not appear if the object can't be moved. In addition <code>moveCursor</code> is now customizable with the property <code>moveCursor</code>.
  <br/>The biggest change is the possibility of cusomizing the look of controls. Both border and controls can be filled and stroked and can also have a dash-array instead of a continue line. Corners can be both square or round.<br />To control those feature you can use those new properties:
  <pre>
  borderDashArray: Dash stroke of borders
  cornerDashArray: Dash stroke of corners
  cornerStrokeColor: If corners are filled, this property controls the color of the stroke
  cornerStyle: standrd 'rect' or 'circle'
  selectionBackgroundColor: add an opaque or transparent layer to the selected object.
  </pre>
  </p>
