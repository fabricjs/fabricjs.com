  <h3>Version 3.0.0</h3>
  <p>
Support for Node 4 and 6 is removed, now fabricJS uses JSDOM 15.1 also as SVG parser under node, and uses node-canvas 2.5+.
This brings improved support under node, including better text support.<br />
splitByGrapheme and strokeUniform have been properly fixed.<br />
Some new properties: <code>fabric.Shadow</code> gets nonScaling that makes the shadow fixed during scaling operations, <code>fabric.disableStyleCopyPaste</code>
will control style copy/pasting during copy operations between IText and Textbox objects. Finally <code>Canvas.enablePointerEvents</code> will let you use
pointer events instead of mouse events.
For image filtering <code>fabric.forceGLPutImageData</code> will let you set a slower but more compatible webgl texture copy. This helps on computer running on old intel hardware.
Detecting the presence of the hardware is developer duty.<br />
Finally <code>fabric.Object.objectCaching</code> set to false will disable objectCaching only if current setup does not require it. Is not more a preference than a mandatory setting.
If an object has a clipPath, objectCaching will be automatically activated.

  <h3>Version 2.3.6</h3>
  <p>
    Fixed a regression in spray brush created by the 2.3.5 group fix.
    Make the image class aware of natural dimensions of the image element if available and restored two fingers events that were broken since we improved the normal events.<br />
    The issue of iText interaction fixed in 2.3.5 has been reopened with a less common interaction problem. We are working on automated interaction tests before fixing it.
  </p>
  <pre>

  </pre>
  <h3>Version 2.3.5</h3>
  <p>
    2 notable changes! from now canvas.getObjects() will return a copy of the array of objects. The documentation was never clear about what was given back.
    Not returning a copy was creating subtle strange bugs that often took hours to debug. Also resize filters and color filters should interact properly with
    each other now. On top of this minor improvements in svg import export.
  </p>
  <pre>
- Change: make canvas.getObjects() always return a shallow copy of the array #5162
- Fix: Improve fabric.Pattern.toSVG to look correct on offsets and no-repeat #5164
- Fix: Do not enter edit in Itext if the mouseUp is relative to a group selector #5153
- Improvement: Do not require xlink namespace in front of href attribut for svgs ( is a SVG2 new spec, unsupported ) #5156
- Fix: fix resizeFilter having the wrong cached texture, also improved interaction between filters #5165
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 2.3.4</h3>
  <p>
    Lot of bug fixes and improvement by contributors. A big news: we have an automated visual tests suite that works across browser, node and travis.<br />Notable changes:
  </p>
  <pre>
- Fix: ToSVG was ignoring excludeFromExport for backgroundImage and OverlayImage. #5075
- Fix: ToSVG for circle with start and end angles. #5085
- Fix: Added callback for setPatternFill. #5101
- Fix: Resize filter taking in account multiple scale sources. #5117
- Fix: Blend image filter clean after refilter. #5121
- Fix: Object.toDataURL should not be influenced by zoom. #5139
- Improvement: requestRenderAllBound add to Canvas instance. #5138
- Improvement: Make path bounding cache optional and also reacheable/cleanable #5140
- Improvement: Make the logic of isNeutralState filters work before filtering start. #5129
- Improvement: Added some code to clean up some memory when canvas is disposed in nodejs. #5142
- Fix: Make numeric origins work with group creation. #5143
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 2.3.3</h3>
  <p>
    Some well reported bug got easily fixed. Generic fonts like serif, sans-serif, monospace works again.<br />
    We were quoting the font name for all fonts in order to avoid problem with fonts starting with numbers or with spaces in the family name, but it looks like
    that you cannot do that for serif, sans-serif, fantasy, monospace and cursive. Those are sort of reserved name and must be used without quotes.<br />
    Fabric was leaving trails of text selection if a fast zoom would happen when an itext had selected text or blinking cursor. While this is an edge case created
    by developers, the fix was fairly easy and so we fixed it.<br />
    Also zero width characters were correctly measured but then wrongly retrieved from measuring cache. That whould mean that text would break and also that there was
    a performance hit ( very small ) since a 0 width joiner, spacer, non joiner was always measured and never returned from cache.
    All the fix have been handled in a single PR that you can check here: <br /> <a href="https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pull/5048" >#5048</a>
  </p>
  <h3>Version 2.3.2</h3>

  <pre>
 - Fix: justify + charspacing + textDecoration Add and improve more events for transformations and mouse interaction. #5007 #5009
 - Fix: Enter edit on object selected programmatically. #5010
 - Fix: Canvas.dispose was not removing all events properly. #5020
 - Fix: Make rgba and hsla regex work case insensitive. #5017
 - Fix: Make group transitioning from not cached to cached work. #5021</pre>
  <h3>Version 2.3.0</h3>
  <p>Added new events and a performance improvement for pixel transparency on cached object.<br />
    Cached objects gets now sampled directly on their cached to check for transparency without a repaint.
    <br />Check the new events <a href="/new-events">here</a></p>
  <pre>
- Add and improve more events for transformations and mouse interaction #4979
- Improvement: whenever possible use cache for target transparency sampling #4955</pre>
  <h3>Version 2.2.4</h3>
  <p>Just fixes to brushes, filters and events mostly coming from contributors.<br />
    A new method is added isPartiallyOnscreen for objects, helps you identify when the object is crossing your viewport boundaries and an important bug in statefull processing is fixed that was causing type errors when comparing an array with null or an object with null or a string</p>
  <pre>

  </pre>
  <h3>Version 2.2.3</h3>
  <p>There are mixed changes. Most of them are about toSVG and fromSVG without new big features.<br />
  There 2 changes that may interests you and change how your code behaves:<br />
  When rotating an object by mouse, the origins are no more forced to be centered, that means that top and left of the rotating object
  will not change to centerPoint without you asking for that. Top and Left will change accordingly to what you see on screen, like it happens
  for scale, skew and translate. Is a good change, but it may be considered a behaviour change. I did not feel like leave it like this nor to issue
  a major version for it. <br />
  Another change is that setSrc on image is also going to reset width and heigth to the one of the element. Since width and height now crop an image
  or just render it with white space around if dimensions do not match, changing width and heigth back to default is something that i consider a bugfix.
  If you built a feature between 2.0 and 2.2.2 that rely on swapping image sources and not changing widht and height, this may gonna break.
