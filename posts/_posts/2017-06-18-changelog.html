  </pre>
  <h3>Version 2.3.3</h3>
  <p>
    Some well reported bug got easily fixed. Generic fonts like serif, sans-serif, monospace works again.<br />
    We were quoting the font name for all fonts in order to avoid problem with fonts starting with numbers or with spaces in the family name, but it looks like
    that you cannot do that for serif, sans-serif, fantasy, monospace and cursive. Those are sort of reserved name and must be used without quotes.<br />
    Fabric was leaving trails of text selection if a fast zoom would happen when an itext had selected text or blinking cursor. While this is an edge case created
    by developers, the fix was fairly easy and so we fixed it.<br />
    Also zero width characters were correctly measured but then wrongly retrieved from measuring cache. That whould mean that text would break and also that there was
    a performance hit ( very small ) since a 0 width joiner, spacer, non joiner was always measured and never returned from cache.
    All the fix have been handled in a single PR that you can check here: <br /> <a href="https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pull/5048" >#5048</a>
  </p>
  <h3>Version 2.3.2</h3>
  <p>Lot of small IText fixes and a group caching bug removed.</p>
  <pre>
 - Fix: justify + charspacing + textDecoration Add and improve more events for transformations and mouse interaction. #5007 #5009
 - Fix: Enter edit on object selected programmatically. #5010
 - Fix: Canvas.dispose was not removing all events properly. #5020
 - Fix: Make rgba and hsla regex work case insensitive. #5017
 - Fix: Make group transitioning from not cached to cached work. #5021</pre>
  <h3>Version 2.3.0</h3>
  <p>Added new events and a performance improvement for pixel transparency on cached object.<br />
    Cached objects gets now sampled directly on their cached to check for transparency without a repaint.
    <br />Check the new events <a href="/new-events">here</a></p>
  <pre>
- Add and improve more events for transformations and mouse interaction #4979
- Improvement: whenever possible use cache for target transparency sampling #4955</pre>
  <h3>Version 2.2.4</h3>
  <p>Just fixes to brushes, filters and events mostly coming from contributors.<br />
    A new method is added isPartiallyOnscreen for objects, helps you identify when the object is crossing your viewport boundaries and an important bug in statefull processing is fixed that was causing type errors when comparing an array with null or an object with null or a string</p>
  <pre>
- Fix getPointer on touch devices #4866
- Fix issues with selectionDashArray bleeding into free drawing #4894
- Fix blur filter for nodejs #4905
- Fix Register mousemove as non passive to help touch devices #4933
- Fix modified shadow tosvg for safari compatibility #4934
- Fix shader to avoid premultiplied alpha pixel getting dirty in blend filter #4936
- Add isPartiallyOnScreen method #4856
- Fix isEqual failing on array/null or objects/null/string compare #4949
- Fix pencilBrush with alpha and with rerendering canvas #4938
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 2.2.3</h3>
  <p>There are mixed changes. Most of them are about toSVG and fromSVG without new big features.<br />
  There 2 changes that may interests you and change how your code behaves:<br />
  When rotating an object by mouse, the origins are no more forced to be centered, that means that top and left of the rotating object
  will not change to centerPoint without you asking for that. Top and Left will change accordingly to what you see on screen, like it happens
  for scale, skew and translate. Is a good change, but it may be considered a behaviour change. I did not feel like leave it like this nor to issue
  a major version for it. <br />
  Another change is that setSrc on image is also going to reset width and heigth to the one of the element. Since width and height now crop an image
  or just render it with white space around if dimensions do not match, changing width and heigth back to default is something that i consider a bugfix.
  If you built a feature between 2.0 and 2.2.2 that rely on swapping image sources and not changing widht and height, this may gonna break.
