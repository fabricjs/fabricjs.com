import { CodeEditor } from '../../../components/CodeEditor';
import { code, code2 } from './code';

This demo show how to start using the custom controls api.
This first example show how to write a custom render method for your control and how to define a custom action to run on the control mouseup.
The new api offers the ability to run custom actions on:

- mousedown
- mouseup
- mousemove

And to run custom code for

- positioning
- rendering
- cursor style

## Creating the control

We create a new control and we add it to the object.
To create a control we use `javascript>new fabric.Control(options)`
In this case we want the corner to be near the top right classic control, so we give it a position of x of 0.5 that is the extreme right of the bounding box of the object.
Same for y at -0.5. We do not want it to overlap with the current top right corner, so we add an `offsetY` with a positive number that will make it render a bit more down.

We want our control to render an icon rather than a fabric supported circle or square.
So we have to provide our own render function to the control.
The function is receiving the canvas context as first argument and so a simple drawImage will make it.

For the custom action we want simply to delete the object.
We build a function following the mouseUpHandler signature and we use there `javascript>canvas.remove(target)`;

<div className="controls">
  <p>
    <button id="add">Add a rectangle</button>
  </p>
</div>
<CodeEditor code={code} canvasId="test1" client:idle>
    <canvas  width="600" height="500" id="test1"></canvas>
</CodeEditor>

## Adding a clone control

Let's add a new control to allow for quick duplication of the Object.
We use again `javascript>new fabric.Control(options)` and we add it to a key named `clone`.
When the objects are shrunk too much, corners with offset do not look great, so in this case
let's try to keep them outside the bounding box, on the top.

For the clone functionality we will simply do `javascript>target.clone(function(cloned) { canvas.add(cloned) });`

<div className="controls">
    <p>
      <button id="add2">Add a rectangle</button>
    </p>
  </div>
<CodeEditor code={code2} canvasId="test2" client:idle>
    <canvas  width="600" height="500" id="test2"></canvas>
</CodeEditor>
