  <h3>Version 1.7.15</h3>
  <p>Quick bug fix release and and 2 improvements. Shadow with no offset can be cached, and this is a speed boost if you are using shadow to do halos.<br />
  Added a note in text docs that allow devs to ovveride some custom key behaviour
  </p>
  <pre>
  Improvement: Made iText keymap public. #4053
  Improvement: Fix a bug in updateCacheCanvas that was returning always true #4051
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.14</h3>
  <p>Cache improvement release! Two new features are now in the cache system. The cache will not grow over certain sizes when scaling objects, and also the _cacheCanvas will be resized in advance by a 10% margin so that we do not have to resize each mousemove event.<br />
  Check <a href="/fabric-object-caching">here</a> for more details<br />
  The staefull check has been speed up a bit taking inspiration from <code>fast-deep-equal</code> package on npm.<br />
  Some bug relative to deep state check and group that where invalidating the cache for weird reason have been hopefully solved.</p>
  <pre>
  Improvement: Avoid cache canvas to resize each mouse move step. #4037
  Improvement: Make cache canvas limited in size. #4035
  Fix: Make groups and statefull cache work. #4032
  Add: Marked the hiddentextarea from itext so that custom projects can recognize it. #4022
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.13</h3>
  <p>Small bugfix release</p>
  <pre>
  Fix: Try to minimize delay in loadFroJson #4007
  Fix: allow fabric.Color to parse rgba(x,y,z,.a) without leading 0 #4006
  Allow path to execute Object.initialize, make extensions easier #4005
  Fix: properly set options from path fromDatalessObjects #3995
  Check for slice before action.slice. Avoid conflicts with heavy customized code. #3992
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.12</h3>
  <p>Bug fixes and some new properties added to mouse events.</p>
  <pre>
  Fix: removed possible memleaks from window resize event. #3984
  Fix: restored default cursor to noTarget only. unselectable objects get the standard hovercursor. #3953

  Fix: After addWithUpdate or removeWithUpdate object coords must be updated. #3911
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.11</h3>
  <p>Hotifx for broken PathGroups (SVGs)</p>
  <h3>Version 1.7.10</h3>
  <p>Many fixes to be a minor release: <br />
  Fixes to SVG export for polygons and for radial gradients in general.
  Introducing a caching logic for groups that allow to smart cache what has not shadow as children object. This should reduce caching visual errors by much and still
  allowing for cache optimization.<br />
  Introduced some manual checks on the value of Math.cos so that we can output a correct angle of 90 or 270 degrees for objects.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Fix: correct svg export for radial gradients #3807
    Fix: Update fireout events to export the event object #3853
    Fix: Improve callSuper to avoid infinite loops (not all of them) #3844

    Fix: toDatelessObject for Group #3863
    Improvement: better caching logic for groups #3864
    Fix: correct svg gradient export for radial in polygons #3866
    Fix: First draw could be empty for some objects #3870
    Fix: Always send event data to object:selected #3871
    Improvement: reduce angle calculation error #3872
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.9</h3>
  <p>Small fixes for text related problems. If you are using text in your application, you should update.</p>
  <pre>
    Fix: Avoid textarea wrapping from chome v57+ #3804
    Fix: double click needed to move cursor when enterEditing is called programatically #3804
    Fix: Style regression when inputing new style objects #3804
    Add: try to support crossOrigin for svg image tags #3804
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.8 and 1.7.7</h3>
  <p>
    This is maybe the last release of the 1.x branch. New important and api breaking work is in progress and will be labeled as fabric 2.x <br />
    The change i like most comes from a casual contributor, <code>by12</code> and fixes path bounding box calculation. No more trimmed paths!<br />
    A change in translation on the cache canvas fixed blurriness introduced since 1.7.3, that is also worth an update.<br />
    For iText, Textbox typers, the style object does not get polluted with useless empty objects now.<br />
    And last but not the least, we have a new flag called <code>fabric.StaticCanvas.prototype.skipOffscreen</code> default to <code>false</code>
    that will calculate with objects aCoords if the object is on the screen or outside the screen and will skip the rendering part completely.
    This is an optional feature but it turns out to be very usefull when you are dealing with large number of objects and you are using zoom or panning much.<br />
    While object.oCoords needs to be updated every zoom/pan, aCoords are static with object position and are still valid when we change the viewport. This allows us
    to detect if they are offscreen simply calculating the viewportCoords at the expense of 2 transformed points calculation. A demo page will follow soon.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Fix: Fix dirty flag propagation #3782
    Fix: Path parsing error in bounding boxes of curves #3774
    Add: Middle click mouse management on canvas #3764

    fix for deselected event not fired on mouse actions #3716
    fix for blurriness introduced on 1.7.3 #3721
  </pre>
  <h3>Version 1.7.6 ( plus 1.7.5 and 1.7.4)</h3>
  <p>
    New functionalities about coordinates:
    Now setCoords updates both the corner coords for mouse interaction and a new set called aCoords that is a set of absolute coordinates that a dev can use for its own calculation on positions.<br />
    Introduced a set of coordinates on canvas that let you figure out where the current viewport start and finish.
    A new method for objects, called `isOnScreen` let;s you find out if at least a corner of an object is visible in the current viewport
    Fabric.Color class now can export colors in HEX + opacity format
    Notable fixes:
    We switched some touch event handling to accomodate latest chrome changes

  </pre>

  <h3>Version 1.7.3</h3>
  <p>Mixed release, cleaning and important bugfixes.<br /> Objects <code>fromObject</code> methods have been reworked to be able to wait for Patterns
  full loading process before actually creating the object, so that the first render has the pattern ready to show. That was a longstanding bug since 2013.<br />
  Reworked some of the canvas background and overlay code so that gradient and patterns works and are saved and reloaded correctly.<br />
  During loadFromJSON process, if an image errors out, the process cotinue smooth, the reviver function is invoked with a third argument <code>error</code>
  equal to true.<br/>
  Usuals objectCaching improvements: dirty flag propagation from childObjects to parents, added a couple of pixels around the cache canvas to avoid aliasing,
  added bigger padding for text with custom fonts.
  </p>
  <pre>
    Improvement: mousewheel event has target in the arguments as all the other events. object now fires mousewheel
    Improvement: Pattern loads for canvas background and overlay, corrected svg pattern export.
    Fix: Wait for pattern loading before calling callback.
    Fix: add 2 extra pixels to cache canvases to avoid aliasing cut.
    Fix: Rerender when deselect an itext editing object.
    Fix: save new state of dimensionProperties at every cache clear.
    Improvement: Better error managment in loadFromJSON.
    Improvement: do not reload backgroundImage as an image if is different type.
    Improvement: if a children element is set dirty, set the parent dirty as well.

  </p>
  <p>
    The font-family quoting from 1.6.4 has been reverted because it made no possible to use multiple font family names. So if you are using a font family that has a name with spaces and numbers you have to wrap in in quotes by yourself.

  </pre>

  <h3>Version 1.6.4</h3>
  <p>In fabric 1.6.4 we added some new features and refinement to text objects:
    <br />New feature <code>charspacing</code> has been added, charspacing is expressed in thousands of em unit, meaning that with a value of 1000 and a fontsize of 40, you will have an additional space of 40px between chars.
    <br />Lineheight managment has been improved, now the lineheight does not have an extra padding below the line if there are no other lines of text.
    <br />Now that HiddenTextarea of iText object can follow the typing cursor better, it has been attached again to body of document and thanks to this IE browsers copy paste has been fixed.
    <br /><code>selection:changed</code> event firing has been reduced so that it fires just when necessary
    <br />Fonts with particular names, like 'Slabo 27px' or 'Exo 2' should be handled correctly now.
  </p>
  <p>We have one new filter, a generic <code>ColorMatrix</code> filter from one of our contributors.</p>
  <p>An old missing feature has been finally added, when restoring object from JSON, the apply filter function is executed before firing the callback, so that we can re render the canvas when everything is properly set up</p>
  <p>Other small fixes to svg import and zoomed canvas. Finally shift click to select and unselect should work on every canvas zoom/pan.</p>
  <p>New event: <code>object:deselected</code> is fired when an object loose its active state. Other than that, to the <code>before:selection:cleared</code> and <code>selection:cleared</code> the target is passed as an argument to the event fired.</p>
  <p>This is the raw changelog:</p>
  <pre>

  <h3>Version 1.6.2</h3>
  <img src="/article_assets/1.6.2.png" style="margin-bottom:20px">

  <p>With 1.6.2 we introduce some new customization options for controls and user interaction. It is now possible to customize the keys used for control interaction.<br />Before those where the predefined keys:</p>
  <pre>
  Alt Key: Switching from normal transform to centered transform during scaling objects.
  Shift Key: on br,bl,tr,lt was switching from proportional to free resize, on mt, ml, mr, bw was switching between resize and skew.
  </pre>
  <p>As of 1.6.2 is possible to use those configuration option to define which keys are used:</p>
  <pre>
  * values: altKey, shiftKey, ctrlKey,
  fabric.Object.uniScaleKey: key used to switch between proportional and not proportional scaling
  fabric.Object.altActionKey: key used to switch between different action on same corner (skew/scale)
  fabric.Object.centeredKey: key used to switch on/off the centered transform
  </pre>
  <p><code>hoverCursor</code> now appears also on non selectable objects but <code>moveCursor</code> does not appear if the object can't be moved. In addition <code>moveCursor</code> is now customizable with the property <code>moveCursor</code>.
  <br/>The biggest change is the possibility of cusomizing the look of controls. Both border and controls can be filled and stroked and can also have a dash-array instead of a continue line. Corners can be both square or round.<br />To control those feature you can use those new properties:
  <pre>
  borderDashArray: Dash stroke of borders
  cornerDashArray: Dash stroke of corners
  cornerStrokeColor: If corners are filled, this property controls the color of the stroke
  cornerStyle: standrd 'rect' or 'circle'
  selectionBackgroundColor: add an opaque or transparent layer to the selected object.
  </pre>
  </p>

  <p>Small bugfixes includes: Itext firing <code>object:modified</code> on text change, possibility to restore custom canvas properties other than objects during canvas loadFromJSON, some SVG color output fix and some dataURL improvements.<br />This is the raw changelog:</p>
  <pre>
  Fix: restore canvas properties on loadFromJSON with includeProperties. #2921

  Improvement: Allow customization of keys that iteract with mouse action ( multiselect key, free tranform key, alternative action key, centered transform key ) #2925
  Added: Make iText fires object:modified on text change on exit editing #2927
  Added: [control customization part 1] cornerDashArray, borderDashArray. Now borderScaleFactor influences both border and controls, changed default corner size to 13 #2932
  Fix: createSVGFontFacesMarkup was failing to retrieve fonts in style #2935
  Fix: shadow not scaled with dataUrl to multiplier #2940
  Added: [control customization part 2] cornerStrokeColor. Now is possible to specify separate stroke and fill color for the controls #2933
