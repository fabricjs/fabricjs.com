      <p>Stefan (<a href="http://twitter.com/kienzle_s">kienzle_s</a>) is 29 years old, from Stuttgart, Germany.</p>

      <p>Between 2005 and 2008 he studied business informatics at the <a href="http://www.dhbw-stuttgart.de/service/english/about-us.html">Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University</a>.</p>

      <p>Since 2010 Stefan has been using Fabric.js in a HTML5 project to draw interactive car accident sketches. During this time he learned a lot about Fabric.js and JavaScript.</p>

      <p>In 2013 he was asked to participate as an active contributor in the Fabric.js github project. Since then he's been doing his best to improve the library and help other guys with the usage of Fabric.js.</p>

      <p>Stefan is very interested in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. At work (at the insurance company) he codes web applications by using the Oracle PL/SQL language and HTML/JavaScript.</p>

    <div class="bio">
      <p>Andrea was born in 1979, Rome Italy.</p>
      <p>Since 2005 he is working as a software developer. He became very interested in web programming since AJAX came out.</p>
      <p>He mainly develops company internal software in PHP, Javascript, HTML + CSS, using LAMP stack, but also enjoys "good old" C code on strange devices.</p>
      <p>He found Fabric.js out of private interest and is now having fun with it, improving his Javascript and canvas skills.</p>
      <p>To give back, he helps fix library bugs, adds features, and assists people with their issues.</p>
