## Fabric.js release highlights
Find general upgrades notes <a href="/upgrade-guide">here</a>

### Version 5.0.0

This is last major version of fabricJS written in ES5.
There aren't big new breaking changes, the main reason for the major increase was a node update that was required to remove a vulnerability in a JSDOM sub dependency, we bumped node to 14 minimum and we removed many deprecated methods.
There is a full list of changes in order to handle this upgrade at this link: [v5 breaking changes](/v5-breaking-changes).

There are also many changes from the contributors, especially Sachar and Steve, that are officially part of the team now.

Nice additions:
- you can now draw a straight line with pencil brush pressing shiftKey
- it is now possible to access all animations that are currently running, see [`fabric.runningAnimations`](/fabric-intro-part-2#running_animations) [Shachar Nencel](https://github.com/ShaMan123)
- The Eraser brush (optional) has been rewritten in order to fix some problems and now supports undoing out of the box [Shachar Nencel](https://github.com/ShaMan123)
- add pathAlign to text on paths [Steve Eberhardt](https://github.com/melchiar)
- stroke bounding box for objects with acute angles has been fixed almost completely (`miter` is fully supported) [Shachar Nencel](https://github.com/ShaMan123)

Notable fixes:
- many control box fixes
- performance fix after canvas resize
- performance fix for rtl/ltr
- performance fix for 0 width textlines

And:
- different reported security issues
- path measurements consistency fixes
- 2 small fixes in gesture handling

### Version 4.4.0

The highlights of this versions are:

We added target to each selection event, so you can stop using this, and you can use fat arrows function freely for event handling. This is a change of direction, so if you notice some event that can benefit from having the target specified rather than using the `this` keyword, please open an issue and we can address it.

A new property on pencil brush, `limitedToCanvasSize` will let you stop drawing outside the canvas.

There is a new property on objects that is currently an experiment.
We do want to support a more flexible way to select objects, so we added a property, called `activeOn`, that will let you specify `up` or `down` and this will let you select the object either on mousedown/touchstart  or mouseup/touchend, to account for interactions with dragging for example.
Now this is an *experiment*, meaning that we want to add more flavours to it, like for example, can it be multi selected? Can it be shift selected, can it be drag selected?
You can experiment with this value, but you have to consider the behaviour may slightly change and you will have to correct your app later on.
Consider it a beta feature. We marked it as @private in the docs, and we clarified it as experimental.

There are an handful of fixes, some of them found and contributed back from developers outside the project.
Thank you @zhangshine, @rileygowan @CharlesRA.

Also 3 bugs fixed and small improvements.

A special thanks to those people for contributing in this release:

```

### Version 4.3.0
New feature: Text on a path!
This was a long time requested feature, with the name of curved text. We decided to go to path support, and leave developers figure out how to do a path that looks like a curve.
This feature is still in BETA, meaning that it renders correctly, with most features of static text.
It does not account for text editing or wrapping or multiline.
(check pr [#6543](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pull/6543))

Another new feature of this release is the ability to specify control size per control rather than per obejct.
fabric.Control.sizeX and fabric.Control.sizeY will take precedence on cornerSize.
(check pr [#6562](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pull/6562))

### Version 4.2.0
Just minor fixes, mouseup event can again have a different target compared to mousedown, and the textbox controls correctly fire a resize event rather than a scaling one.
```
- fix(fabric.utils): ISSUE-6566 Fix SVGs for special Arc lines [#6571](https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pull/6571)

```

### Version 4.1.0
Added a `before:path:created` event, as a user request, in order to handle brushes objects before they get added to canvas.
Generic Path change of logic. Now complex SVG paths are simplified into an absolute only command version. On top of that, A, S, T, V and H commands are converted to C, Q and L. With this done, it is simpler to connect custom controls to path properties, and also it made it possible to add a path measure utility that we will need to implement the long requested text on a path feature.
```
- feat(Brushes): add beforePathCreated event #6492;

  A couple of deprecation for <code>Object.setGradient</code>. A new doc page explaining gradients from top to bottom coming soon.
```
- SVG import: Implement fill-opacity in on Path objects with gradients. #5812
- Animation: Trigger onChange and onComplete with the right values. #5813
- SVG import: Fix gradient parsing. #5836
```
### Version 3.3.0
Rewrite pointer/touch events! It seems now that pointer events and touch events can work correctly with multi fingers.
Attention has been made in freedrawing with accidental multi touch usage and ability to work with pencils.
Also a small fix for the word boundaries in text.
Some deprecation on old event properties required another minor version bump.
```
 - Differently support multi mouse events. #5785
 - Word boundary search update. #5788
```
### Version 3.2.0
This version is mainly a bug fix release for the new feature. It gets a minor bump because of official deprecation of Object.transformMatrix.
```
 - Fix Group.toSVG export missing opacity and visibility. #5755
 - Pass raw event information to brushes. #5687
 - Added deprecation warning for Object.transformMatrix. #5747
 - Fix decimante points breaking point drawing in freedrawing. #5771
```
### Version 3.1.0
A new property to the pencil brush has been added. The `decimate` will allow you to remove extra points to the brush and simplify the outcoming path.
also when parsing floats from SVG, now scientific notation with uppercase E is supported.

```
 - Fix free draw positioning. #5718
 - Improvement: Support scientific notation with uppercase E. #5731
 - Add: PencilBrush brush now support decimate property to remove dots that are too near to each other. #5718
```
### Version 3.0.0
Support for Node 4 and 6 is removed, now fabricJS uses JSDOM 15.1 also as SVG parser under node, and uses node-canvas 2.5+.
This brings improved support under node, including better text support.
splitByGrapheme and strokeUniform have been properly fixed.
Some new properties: <code>fabric.Shadow</code> gets nonScaling that makes the shadow fixed during scaling operations, <code>fabric.disableStyleCopyPaste</code>
will control style copy/pasting during copy operations between IText and Textbox objects. Finally <code>Canvas.enablePointerEvents</code> will let you use
pointer events instead of mouse events.
For image filtering <code>fabric.forceGLPutImageData</code> will let you set a slower but more compatible webgl texture copy. This helps on computer running on old intel hardware.
Detecting the presence of the hardware is developer duty.
Finally <code>fabric.Object.objectCaching</code> set to false will disable objectCaching only if current setup does not require it. Is not more a preference than a mandatory setting.
If an object has a clipPath, objectCaching will be automatically activated.
```

### Version 2.3.6

Fixed a regression in spray brush created by the 2.3.5 group fix.
Make the image class aware of natural dimensions of the image element if available and restored two fingers events that were broken since we improved the normal events.
The issue of iText interaction fixed in 2.3.5 has been reopened with a less common interaction problem. We are working on automated interaction tests before fixing it.

```
- Fix: Make image.class aware of naturalWidth and naturalHeight. #5178
- Fix: Make 2 finger events works again #5177
- Fix: Make Groups respect origin and correct position ( fix spray/circle brushes ) #5176
```
### Version 2.3.5

2 notable changes! From now canvas.getObjects() will return a copy of the array of objects. The documentation was never clear about what was given back. Not returning a copy was creating subtle strange bugs that often took hours to debug. Also resize filters and color filters should interact properly with each other now. On top of this minor improvements in svg import export.

```
- Change: make canvas.getObjects() always return a shallow copy of the array #5162
- Fix: Improve fabric.Pattern.toSVG to look correct on offsets and no-repeat #5164
- Fix: Do not enter edit in Itext if the mouseUp is relative to a group selector #5153
- Improvement: Do not require xlink namespace in front of href attribut for svgs ( is a SVG2 new spec, unsupported ) #5156
- Fix: fix resizeFilter having the wrong cached texture, also improved interaction between filters #5165
```
### Version 2.3.4

Lot of bug fixes and improvement by contributors. A big news: we have an automated visual tests suite that works across browser, node and travis.

Notable changes:

```
- Fix: ToSVG was ignoring excludeFromExport for backgroundImage and OverlayImage. #5075
- Fix: ToSVG for circle with start and end angles. #5085
- Fix: Added callback for setPatternFill. #5101
- Fix: Resize filter taking in account multiple scale sources. #5117
- Fix: Blend image filter clean after refilter. #5121
- Fix: Object.toDataURL should not be influenced by zoom. #5139
- Improvement: requestRenderAllBound add to Canvas instance. #5138
- Improvement: Make path bounding cache optional and also reacheable/cleanable #5140
- Improvement: Make the logic of isNeutralState filters work before filtering start. #5129
- Improvement: Added some code to clean up some memory when canvas is disposed in nodejs. #5142
- Fix: Make numeric origins work with group creation. #5143
```
### Version 2.3.3

Some well reported bugs got easily fixed. Generic fonts like serif, sans-serif, monospace works again. We were quoting the font name for all fonts in order to avoid problem with fonts starting with numbers or with spaces in the family name, but it looks like that you cannot do that for serif, sans-serif, fantasy, monospace and cursive. Those are sort of reserved name and must be used without quotes. Fabric was leaving trails of text selection if a fast zoom would happen when an itext had selected text or blinking cursor. While this is an edge case created by developers, the fix was fairly easy and so we fixed it. Also zero width characters were correctly measured but then wrongly retrieved from measuring cache. That whould mean that text would break and also that there was a performance hit ( very small ) since a 0 width joiner, spacer, non joiner was always measured and never returned from cache. All the fix have been handled in a single PR that you can check here: <br /> <a href="https://github.com/fabricjs/fabric.js/pull/5048" >#5048</a>

### Version 2.3.2
Lot of small IText fixes and a group caching bug removed.
```
 - Fix: justify + charspacing + textDecoration Add and improve more events for transformations and mouse interaction. #5007 #5009
 - Fix: Enter edit on object selected programmatically. #5010
 - Fix: Canvas.dispose was not removing all events properly. #5020
 - Fix: Make rgba and hsla regex work case insensitive. #5017
 - Fix: Make group transitioning from not cached to cached work. #5021```
### Version 2.3.0
Added new events and a performance improvement for pixel transparency on cached object. Cached objects gets now sampled directly on their cached to check for transparency without a repaint. Check the new events <a href="/new-events">here</a>
```
- Add and improve more events for transformations and mouse interaction #4979
- Improvement: whenever possible use cache for target transparency sampling #4955```
### Version 2.2.4
Just fixes to brushes, filters and events mostly coming from contributors.
A new method is added isPartiallyOnscreen for objects, helps you identify when the object is crossing your viewport boundaries and an important bug in statefull processing is fixed that was causing type errors when comparing an array with null or an object with null or a string
```
- Fix getPointer on touch devices #4866
- Fix issues with selectionDashArray bleeding into free drawing #4894
- Fix blur filter for nodejs #4905
- Fix Register mousemove as non passive to help touch devices #4933
- Fix modified shadow tosvg for safari compatibility #4934

- Add isPartiallyOnScreen method #4856
- Fix isEqual failing on array/null or objects/null/string compare #4949
- Fix pencilBrush with alpha and with rerendering canvas #4938
```
### Version 2.2.3
There are mixed changes. Most of them are about toSVG and fromSVG without new big features.<br />
  There 2 changes that may interests you and change how your code behaves:<br />
  When rotating an object by mouse, the origins are no more forced to be centered, that means that top and left of the rotating object
  will not change to centerPoint without you asking for that. Top and Left will change accordingly to what you see on screen, like it happens
  for scale, skew and translate. Is a good change, but it may be considered a behaviour change. I did not feel like leave it like this nor to issue
  a major version for it. <br />
  Another change is that setSrc on image is also going to reset width and heigth to the one of the element. Since width and height now crop an image
  or just render it with white space around if dimensions do not match, changing width and heigth back to default is something that i consider a bugfix.
  If you built a feature between 2.0 and 2.2.2 that rely on swapping image sources and not changing widht and height, this may gonna break.
